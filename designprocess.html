									<h1>Client Design Brief<br /></h1>
								
									<h5>"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. 
									   Design is how it works."</h5>
									<p> Each client is unique so an iterative and adaptable design process that fits 
										within client’s methodology are being employed. 
										Each process varies depending on the service required which includes branding, 
										web/mobile app design and user interface design. Good design takes time so depending 
										on the requirements, getting to know and understanding what the client's need is important. 
										With that, I start off by guiding myself with the design process below.</p>

									Having a design process provides me with a framework 
									on how to best tackle a problem 
									by breaking it down into a series of interconnected systems. 
									It is to provide a holistic overview.<br>
									
							  </div>
							  <br>
							  <div class="col-sm-6">
									There are many factors such as time constraints, pivoting and limited 
									resources that can affect the outcome of design stages. 
									Each of these stages require feedback and approval from the client 
									before moving on to the next one. Below is the overview of 
									how I typically approach the design project.

									  		<h6>User First.</h6>
										<ol>
										  <li>First things first: picking the client’s brain. 
										  	<p>Before any designing can occur, this must happen first. Spending an hour with a potential client, and asking them a ton of in-depth questions about their business, etc. will happen.
										  	<a href="Client Design Brief - Marqui Cruz.pdf">Here’s </a>the logo design brief that is being used.</li>
										  <li>For the Project Proposal: Once all information has been picked up, A project proposal which will detail everything the client needs to know will be put together: how much the project will cost, timeline and deadlines, etc.</li>
										  <li>After the client says they’re agreeing to everything, and down payment has been settled (a standard procedure among most designers) Work can now start.</li>
										  <li>Further Research: This is where a deeper look into the new client’s business and industry happens. Researching everything about the scope of their own company. This gives clues about what their target market cares about, and what might appeal to them the most.</li>
										   
										</ol>	
 									  </div>
									  <div class="col-sm-6">
									  		<h6>Client's Competitor.</h6>  	
										<ol>
										  <li>Research the client's competitors in the market.Spending some time looking up the client’s competitors, usually mostly local, and see what they’re doing in terms of visual identity. </li>
										  <li>Gather resources to carry out the project. Resources are not only the information but also what considerations, tools, etc. are needed to be able to proceed with the creation of project.</li>
										  <li>Look for inspiration: Part where professional design resources are needed; look through numerous design books and websites, and put together a compilation of design from similar industries. This helps get an idea of the direction the client’s goal should go in, and gives some inspiration on different ways of problem solving.
										  <li>Preliminary brainstorming: Sketch out rough ideas. Before turning to the computer, should first spend some time putting pencil to paper. Write out word associations, draw some mind maps, and sketch a good number of concepts. Since this is brainstorming, everything is being drawn before editting and refining of drafts happen later.</li>
										</ol>
									  </div>
									</div>
					 			
									<div class="row">
									  <div class="col-sm-6" >
									  		<h6>Design Phase.</h6>  	
										<ol>
										  <li>After a day or two of brainstorming, it’s important to take a step back from everything and create some space to be able to look at new ideas with new eyes, and sometimes, even come up with a new solution.</li>
										  <li>Computer renditions. Selecting about 3-5 of the strongest ideas that has been sketched, will then use the relevant design programs for the concept with a black and white sketch at this stage for the branding, and a mock up design for the web/mobile app design.
										  <li>Determine the start, processing and end state for each action then build interactive prototypes for the client to demonstrate feedback.</li>

										</ol>
											
									  </div>
									  <div class="col-sm-6">
									  		<h6>Finalization Phase.</h6>
										<ol>
										  <li>Determine whether the visuals are adaptable at various sizes; if responsive, and coordinate with client any technical constraints related to the visuals. </li>
										  <li>If the client is happy with everything, finalization of the logo files in a logo package, which includes Illustrator files, jpg, pdf, png, and anything else they might need or have requested will be sent. That concludes the end of the project for the branding.</li>
										  <li>If the client is satisfied with everything, finalization of the Web/mobile app design will be sent to the client. That includes the end of the project for the UI/UX as well.</li>
										  
										</ol>
